=for ref

Given a time sequence of images, identify "spikes" that exceed a
threshold in a single frame.

This is a voting algorithm based on my ZSPIKE.PRO from the 1990s,
which is available in the solarsoft distribution from Lockheed Martin.

You feed in either a list ref of images, or an XxYxt cube of pixels as
a PDL.  You get back a despiked cube and, in list context, a cube of
spikes.  The output is in the same format you fed in to start with.

The spike detection is based purely on a temporal voting scheme.

You can feed in some options:

=over 3

=item bad 

(default is 0) - if this is set to 1, then the spikes are set to BAD
instead of being interpolated from the surrounding values.

=item nvotes

(default is 3) - number of 'voting' frames on either side of the
central frame; actual number of votes is twice this.

=item nyes

(default is 4) - number of 'voting' frames that must vote the central 
value is a spike, for it to be marked as such.

=item nno

(default is 2) - number of 'voting' frames that must vote NO to veto
marking the central value as a spike.

=item absdiff

(default is undef) - if set, this is an absolute difference, in DN,
required for a pixel to 'vote' its central value.  If the central value
is this much higher than a given voting value, then the central value
is voted to be a spike.  If it's this much lower, the veto count is 
incremented.

=item sigmadiff

(default is undef) - if this is set, then each pixel is treated as a
time series and the calculated sigma (RMS variation from the mean) of 
the timeseries is used to calculate a difference threshold at each 
location.

You can also specify as a multiple of a percentile difference from the 
median of the data, to handle very spiky distributions.  To make that
specification, feed a list ref into sigmadiff.  The spec is [ $pct, $n ],
so that [ 50, 6 ] sets the trigger at 6x the 50th percentile difference
from the median.  That is useful for distirbutions whose RMS value may be
set by frequency of large spikes.
