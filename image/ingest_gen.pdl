=head2 ingest_gen - ingest a generic FITS file

=for ref

This is called by C<ifits>, and is intended to massage FITS files that
are both noncompliant and also not from a recognized instrument.  It
hasn't really been implemented -- this is a stub.  Should ultimately check
things like DATE_OBS and put in a pixel coordinate system.
