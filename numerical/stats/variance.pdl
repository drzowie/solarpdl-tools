=head2 variance - find variance along the 0th dimension

=for usage

  $v = variance($data);

=for ref

Collapses the 0th dimension, returning the statistical variance along
the 0th dimension. Note that this currently performs the "parent distribution" (1/N) calculation, and not the "sample" (1/(N-1)) calculation.

See also PDL::Stats::Basic.

=cut

sub variance {
  my($X) = shift;
  my($mX) = $X->sumover / $X->dim(0);
  return ($X * $X)->sumover/ $X->dim(0) - $mX * $mX ;
