=head2 correlation - correlation coefficient between two PDLs

=for usage

  $corr = correlation($x,$y);

=for ref

This is the covariance of the two variables, divided by their individual
variances.

=cut

sub correlation {
  my($X) = shift->double;
  my($Y) = shift->double;
  return covariance($X,$Y) / variance($X) / variance($Y);
}
