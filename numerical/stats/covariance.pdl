=head2 covariance - find covariance of two identically sized PDLs

=for usage

  $cov = covariance($x,$y);

=for ref

The covariance of two random variables X and Y is given by 
Cov(X,Y)= mean(XY) - mean(X)mean(Y).

=cut

sub covariance {
  my($X) = shift;
  my($Y) = shift;
  return ( (  ($X * $Y)->sumover - ($X->sumover * $Y->sumover)/$X->dim(0) ) / $X->dim(0) );
}
