<p>A single flux concentration's tracking data should include:
 <ul>
 <li> Value, location, &amp; size for all times
 <li> Pointers to neighbors?
 <li> Origin and demise information
 </ul>

<p>A collection of flux concentrations come and go from frame to frame,
so there should also be a per-frame (time-keyed?) list of concentrations that
is valid for the whole data set.

<hr>

<p>Three pieces of code are needed:
<dl>

<dt><code>frag_detect</code><dd>locates where and what size each flux
concentration is in each frame, using time/space hysteresis.  It takes
as input a collection of magnetograms and emits a collection of
masks, +1 for positive-going features and -1 for negative-going features.

<dt><code>frag_id</code><dd>Inputs are the images and the masks
from frag_detect.  Output is a list of number-keyed masks (a la Parnell's
code) with numbers that are unique only within each frame but that identify
individual fragments in that frame.  You can use different discriminator
algorithms here:  `clump' (the default) is similar to Parnell's algorithm
that spreads out to the boundary of each contiguous blob on the mask,
and `downhill' is similar to Hagenaar's algorithm that spreads downward
from each local maximum.

<dt><code>frag_assoc</code><dd>Associates fragements across time
slices.  Inputs are the id images from frag_id and outputs are
twofold: a collection of modified-id images that have consistent id's
between frames; and a collection of fragment lifetime data structures.
The fragment data are in a perl array of hash refs, one hash ref per
fragment.  The modified-id images use the sign bit of the ID to
indicate the direction of each fragment -- but the fragment IDs are
assigned consecutively in absolute value space, so that -3 and 3 can't
both exist.

<dt><code>frag_tabulate</code><dd>Takes an associated image set and produces
a tabulated output containing a list of events in the data set (motions,
mergers, emergences, fragmentations, etc.)

</dl>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
<pre>Note: Still need to investigate some interaction between tabulation and
association code:  downhill method doesn't seem to always make the
proper break.
